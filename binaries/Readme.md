# Motivation

## Architecture

![Architecture of how tools like Photon use the Prisma binaries via the Prisma SDK](https://figma-image-proxy.prisma.now.sh/?id=15:1&file=syRJTHIabeqK69mKHBwSlP)

Binaries are the artifacts generated by compiling the Prisma's core (written in Rust). The following binaries are generated:

### Prisma Query Engine Binary

Prisma query engine binary has the following use cases:

A generator like [`Photon`](https://photonjs.prisma.io)

- Uses this binary to run queries against a data source (at runtime of generated code).
- Binary is downloaded when Photon is generated.

Prisma CLI

- Generation uses this binary to fetch internal schema representation (at the time of running `generate` CLI command).
- Binary is downloaded when the CLI is installed.

### Prisma Migration Engine Binary

Prisma migration engine binary has the following use cases:

A generator like `prisma-test-utils`

- Uses this binary to perform migrations (at runtime of generated code)
- Binary is downloaded when `prisma-test-utils` is generated.

Prisma CLI

- Lift commands use the binary to perform migrations or calculate pending migrations (at the time of running various `lift` commands like `up`, `save` etc).
- Binary is downloaded when the CLI is installed.

### Utility Binaries

#### Prisma Format Binary

VSCode Prisma extension uses this binary for providing code formatting features.

## Requirements

Binaries (query engine binary and migration engine binary) are at the core of Photon, Lift and Prisma CLI via the Prisma SDK. They are, however, compiled for a specific platform, that leads to the following requirements:

- Minimal configuration, simple mental model.
- Possibility of a deterministic binary resolution both locally and production setup.
- Easy setup of development and deployment workflows.

## Use Cases

[See Prisma CLI example scenarios](#example-scenarios)

[See generators (Photon, Nexus etc) example scenarios](#example-scenarios)

### URL Scheme

To download the binary, replace `${package}` with a package (e.g. `darwin`) and `${name}` with the name of the binary above (e.g. `query-engine`):

- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prisma-native/alpha/latest/${package}/${name}
- E.g. https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prisma-native/alpha/latest/darwin/migration-engine

From photon's perspective, we'll download the binaries to `./node_modules/@generated/photon/${package}`.

## Naming Convention

All downloaded binaries must follow the naming convention outlined by the [Table of Binaries](#pre-built-binary-targets).

This includes both binaries downloaded for a generator and downloaded for CLI commands.

## Custom Binary

In case a binary for your platform is not listed in the [Pre-built Binary Targets](#pre-built-binary-targets). Please follow [this section](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/custom_binary/docs/core/generators/photonjs.md#compiling-custom-binary) of the docs to build a custom binary.

# Binary Protocols

## Data Protocol

### Prisma Query Engine Binary

Prisma query engine binary uses GraphQL over HTTP.

### Prisma Migration Engine Binary

Prisma migration engine binary uses JSON RPC over stdio.

## Process management

### Prisma Query Engine Binary

<details><summary>Note about Photon</summary>

<p>The Prisma SDK provides the primitives for generators to perform binary process management. The following section covers Prisma query engine binary process management in Photon</p>
</details>

Prisma SDK provides Photon with `connect`, `disconnect` methods for binary process management. If needed, Photon can lazily connect, when a request is received.

#### Connect

`connect` function is where Photon spawns the query engine binary and the following sequence of events happen

##### Find Free Port

Photon finds a free port by binding to port 0 with a light-weight TCP server (using node net -> createServer), this makes the OS allocate a random (albeit,
pseudo serial) port to this server, then this server is closed and `Photon` saves the port in memory.

##### Binary Spawn

Photon then spawns the binary as a child process and provide it the environment variables including the detected port

This port is then provided to the binary as an environment variable and the binary starts an HTTP server on this port.

##### Waiting for the Binary to be Ready

In this workflow, Photon polls the query engine binary's HTTP server for its stats at an interval. This can be optimized further by reducing the interval or relying on a simple TCP protocol.

#### Disconnect

Calling the `disconnect` method is where Photon waits for any pending request promise to resolve and then kills the spawned process and the DB connection is
released.

### Prisma Migration Engine Binary

<details><summary>Note about Lift</summary>

<p>The Prisma SDK provides the primitives for CLI commands to perform binary process management. The following section covers Prisma migration engine binary process management in `lift` command.</p>
</details>

Prisma SDK provides a similar API for migration engine binary management. The actual process management is similar to query engine binary. With the following noted differences:

1. Migration engine binary uses JSON RPC over stdio as the data protocol.

## Error Handling

Note: Error handling has a separate detailed spec [here](https://github.com/prisma/specs/tree/master/errors). The following briefs on error handling but is not exhaustive.

### Prisma Query Engine Binary

Photon throws if the engine ready polling does not yield success after N attempts. There may be several reasons why preparing a process with the required context might fail, including but not limited to:

| Potential Error                            | Handling Strategy |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Unable to bind to a free port              | Throw error       |
| Binary is not compatible with the platform | Throw error       |
| Binary fails to acquire a DB connection    | Throw error       |

### Prisma Migration Engine Binary

| Potential Error                    | Handling Strategy |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Database credentials are incorrect | Notify user       |
| Database is not reachable          | Notify user       |
| Prisma schema is not valid         | Throw error       |

# Use Case: Prisma CLI

## How to Fetch Binaries

### Environment Variables

Environment variable to configure the binary for CLI (like `prisma2 lift` or `prisma2 generate`):

| Environment Variable             | Description                                                                               | Behavior                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY` | (optional) Overrides the resolution path for migration engine binary for `Lift` commands. | Can be a relative (from CWD) or an absolute path to the binary |
| `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY`     | (optional) Overrides the resolution path for query engine binary for `generate` command.  | Can be a relative (from CWD) or an absolute path to the binary |

- CLI binaries can only be overridden by a path to a custom binary. It does not alter download behavior, it just overrides the binary path provided for respective commands. This means that using [known binaries](#pre-built-binary-targets) is not possible.

### Environment Variables Error Handling

- If the environment variable path to a custom binary is not found, the respective CLI command should throw.

- If the environment variable path to a custom binary exists but the binary is incompatible with the current platform, the respective CLI command should throw.

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Development machine is a Raspberry Pi and the deployment platform is AWS Lambda

As we do not have precompiled binaries for ARM architecture yet, the user would compile binaries manually for Prisma query engine and Prisma migration engine.

```sh
export PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY=<path to compiled migration engine binary>
export PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=<path to compiled query engine binary>
```

Then `prisma2 lift` and `prisma2 generate` would use the respective compiled binaries.

### 2. We are using CLI in a build system from a provider for which we do not have a working pre-compiled binary

Since overriding CLI binary is an environment variable and these providers might [not always allow](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/157#issuecomment-520501500) compiling a binary. There will be no work around such a situation except us making the default downloaded binary for that provider work. We want to support all major providers out of the box and this use case should be rare.

# Use Case: Photon.js Generator

## How to Fetch Binaries

### Configuration

Fields on the `generator` block to configure the availability of binaries for generators (like Photon, nexus, etc):

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `binaryTargets` | _(optional)_ An array of binaries that are required by the application, string for [known binary](#pre-built-binary-targets) targets and path for custom binaries. These are downloaded at generation time. |

Environment variable to configure a specific binary for the generated code's runtime:

| Environment Variable             | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY` | _(optional)_ A string literal with a [known binary](#pre-built-binary-targets) name (like `darwin` or `linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"` or path to a custom binary |
| `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY`     | _(optional)_ A string literal with a [known binary](#pre-built-binary-targets) name (like `darwin` or `linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"` or path to a custom binary |

- Both `binaryTargets` field and `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable are optional. Here are some scenarios

  - `binaryTargets` is not provided.

    ```groovy
    generator photon {
        provider = "photonjs"
    }
    ```

    We download and use the binary for the current platform.

  - Field `binaryTargets` provided with a single value

    ```groovy
    generator photon {
        provider = "photonjs"
        binaryTargets = ["native"]
    }
    ```

    We download the provided binary and resolve it at runtime.

  - Field `binaryTargets` provided with multiple values

    ```groovy
    generator photon {
        provider = "photonjs"
        binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]
    }
    ```

    We download both binaries and resolve the correct binary at runtime by detecting the platform.

  - Field `binaryTargets` provided with multiple values and `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable provided.

    ```groovy
    generator photon {
      provider = "photonjs"
      binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]
    }
    ```

    ```sh
    PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=native # On Local
    ```

    ```sh
    PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2 # In Production
    ```

    We download all the binaries specified by `binaryTargets` and use the binary specified by `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable.

  Note: In production setups with a dedicated CI which has a different platform than the deployment machine (think CircleCI, Netlify), we can configure `binaryTargets` to only include the required binaries:

  ```groovy
    generator photon {
      provider = "photonjs"
      binaryTargets = env("BINARY_TARGETS")
    }
  ```

  With environment variable:

  ```sh
  BINARY_TARGETS=["linux-glibc-libssl1.1.0"] # In CI for CircleCI
  ```

  ```sh
  BINARY_TARGETS=["linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"] # In production for Netlify
  ```

  A configuration like `binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]` is only needed when the development machine is also the machine responsible to build
  for production but the platform in production is different, like `AWS lambda`, `now`, etc.

- Known binaries specified in `binaryTargets` downloads specified known binaries to an OS cache path and copies it to generator path on `generate`.

- Not all generators require all the binaries, the generator spec (TODO: link generator spec when ready) outlines the generator API that defines which binaries are needed.

### Configuration Error Handling

Note: pinned binary in this section refers to binary specified via `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable.

- If the pinned binary is not found during the generated code's runtime, it should throw.

- If the pinned binary is a known binary but does not work for the current platform, try other known binaries from `binaryTargets`. This would make the use cases work where build machine is different from deploy machine, like in the case of zeit's now.

- If the pinned binary is a custom binary but does not work for the current platform, generated code's runtime should throw.

## Runtime

In the scenario where platforms field is defined but no pinnedPlatform field is defined, we resolve the binary at runtime by detecting the platform. This can be achieved by generating code similar to this pseudo-code in Photon.

```ts
function detectPlatform(): string { ... }

const pinnedPlatform = process.env.PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY
const binaries = {
  'mac': <path>,
  'lambda': <path>,
}
let binaryPath
if (!pinnedPlatform) {
  const inferredPlatform = detectPlatform()
  binaryPath = binaries[inferredPlatform]
} else {
  binaryPath = binaries[pinnedPlatform]
}

```

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Development machine is Mac but the deployment platform is AWS lambda.

We can use `binaryTargets` **without** a `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable. Which binary to use will be resolved at runtime, see [Runtime](#runtime) for more details.

```groovy
generator photon {
    provider = "photonjs"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]
}
```

### 2. Deterministically choose the binary-based a runtime environment variable

We can use `binaryTargets` **and** provide a specific binary using `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable.

```groovy
generator photon {
    provider = "photonjs"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]
}
```

```sh
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=native # On Local
```

```sh
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2 # In Production
```

We define the `binaryTargets` and use one of the `binaryTargets`.

### 3. Development machine is Mac but we need a custom binary in production

We use "native" (binary of the current platform) in `binaryTargets` and provide `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` in production.

```groovy
generator photon {
    provider = "photonjs"
    binaryTargets = ["native"]
}
```

```sh
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=custom-prisma-binary # In production
```

### 4. Development machine is a Raspberry Pi and the deployment platform is AWS Lambda

As we do not have precompiled binaries for ARM architecture yet, the user would compile binaries manually for Prisma query engine and use it by providing `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` environment variable

```groovy
generator photon {
    provider = "photonjs"
    binaryTargets = ["linux-glibc-libssl1.0.2"]
}
```

```sh
PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=./custom-query-engine-binary # On local
```

Unset `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY` in production for it to pick the only binary specified in `binaryTargets`.

# Unresolved questions

- [ ] Should we unify different binaries (query engine, migration engine, ...) into one single binary?
- [ ] Some platforms [tally `package.json` with the actual contents of `node_modules`](https://github.com/prisma/photonjs/issues/117), this spec does not address
      that issue.
- [ ] Possible New Dimension: Is libssl built for specific distros? E.g. does libssl1.0.1 built on centos not work for ubuntu? https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/issues/157
