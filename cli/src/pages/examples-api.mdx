# Prisma Examples API

The Prisma 2 example projects serve as "starter kits" for developers who are getting started with Prisma by providing ready-made setups for certain use cases (e.g. a GraphQL, REST or gRPC API).

There are two ways of using an example project:

- Cloning the `prisma-examples` repo and following the instructions in the README of the example
- Selecting an example during the `prisma init` flow when starting with a new/empty database

The first approach always is based on a SQLite database preconfigured in the example's Prisma schema. 

With the second approach, the Prisma CLI must download the example and perform a number of further tasks to make the example ready to use. Here is a list of tasks that need to be performed:

1. Download the selected example project from GitHub
1. Replace the `datasource` configuration in `schema.prisma` with the database credentials provided by the user (noop for SQLite)
1. Migrate the database with Lift, i.e. run:
    1. `prisma2 lift save --name 'init'` 
    1. `prisma2 lift up`
1. Generate Photon, i.e. run: `prisma2 generate`
1. Install npm dependencies, i.e. run: `npm install`
1. Seed the database, i.e. run: `npm run seed`
1. Print instructions what to do next + link to the selected example on GitHub
