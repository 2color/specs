# Prisma CLI Docs

## Design Principles

- [Gatsby CLI design principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv7tBUeqHN4t_UecuEAKVCWAVzQoCmcDoONBmf3HggI/edit#)
- [Language](#language)

## Open Questions

- [ ] Preserve scrollablity (e.g. `docker-compose`)
- [ ] Single terminal dev mode
- [ ] Sync between CLI/Studio
- [ ] `--no-colors` / `PRISMA_CLI_NO_COLORS` to disable colors
- [ ] progress indicator for entire flow / step counter (e.g. step 2/6); since steps are dynamic based on selection, how can the progress be calculcated?
- [ ] figure out "generated example" after introspection with existing DB

## Notes

When an example is selected, the CLI should:

1. replace the data source config in schema.prisma with the DB credentials initially provided (noop for SQLite)
1. migrate DB with Lift
1. generate Photon
1. install npm dependencies
1. seed the DB
1. print instructions

## Language

#### Active vs Passive voice

Passive voice is prefered. 

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
The files were generated.
```

Instead of:

```
We generated these files.
```

_**Rationale**_: It is weird to talk in first person in CLI outputs (i.e. who is "we"?). 

#### Questions vs Imperative

Imperative is preferred.

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
Select the programming language you want to use
```

Instead of:

```
Which programming language do you want to use
```

_**Rationale**_: Imperative is more concise and clear.
