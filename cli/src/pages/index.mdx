# Prisma CLI Docs

## Design Principles

- [Gatsby CLI design principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv7tBUeqHN4t_UecuEAKVCWAVzQoCmcDoONBmf3HggI/edit#)
- [Language](#language)

## Open Questions

- [ ] Preserve scrollablity (e.g. `docker-compose`)
- [ ] Single terminal dev mode
- [ ] Sync between CLI/Studio
- [ ] `--no-colors` / `PRISMA_CLI_NO_COLORS` to disable colors
- [ ] progress indicator for entire flow / step counter (e.g. step 2/6); since steps are dynamic based on selection, how can the progress be calculcated?
- [ ] figure out "generated example" after introspection with existing DB

## Language

#### Active vs Passive voice

Passive voice is prefered. 

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
The files were generated.
```

Instead of:

```
We generated these files.
```

_**Rationale**_: It is weird to talk in first person in CLI outputs (i.e. who is "we"?). 

#### Questions vs Imperative

Imperative is preferred.

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
Select the programming language you want to use
```

Instead of:

```
Which programming language do you want to use
```

_**Rationale**_: Imperative is more concise and clear.
