# Prisma CLI Docs

## Design Principles

- [Gatsby CLI design principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv7tBUeqHN4t_UecuEAKVCWAVzQoCmcDoONBmf3HggI/edit#)

### Language

#### Active vs Passive voice

Passive voice is prefered. 

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
The files were generated.
```

Instead of:

```
We generated these files.
```

_**Rationale**_: It is weird to talk in first person in CLI outputs (i.e. who is "we"?). 

#### Questions vs Imperative

Imperative is preferred.

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
Select the programming language you want to use
```

Instead of:

```
Which programming language do you want to use
```

_**Rationale**_: Imperative is more concise and clear. 

## Open Questions

- [ ] Preserve scrollablity (e.g. `docker-compose`)
- [ ] Single terminal dev mode
- [ ] Sync between CLI/Studio
- [ ] `--no-colors` / `PRISMA_CLI_NO_COLORS` to disable colors

## Notes

When an example is selected, the CLI should:

1. replace the data source config in schema.prisma with the DB credentials initially provided (noop for SQLite)
1. generate Photon
1. install npm dependencies
1. seed the DB
