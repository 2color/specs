## Design Principles

- [Language](#language)

## Language

#### Active vs Passive voice

Passive voice is prefered. 

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
The files were generated.
```

Instead of:

```
We generated these files.
```

_**Rationale**_: It is weird to talk in first person in CLI outputs (i.e. who is "we"?). 

#### Questions vs Imperative

Imperative is preferred.

_**Example**_:

Use:

```
Select the programming language you want to use
```

Instead of:

```
Which programming language do you want to use
```

_**Rationale**_: Imperative is more concise and clear.
