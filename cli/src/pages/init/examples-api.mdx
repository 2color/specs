# Prisma Examples API

## Overview

The Prisma 2 example projects serve as "starter kits" for developers who are getting started with Prisma by providing ready-made setups for certain use cases (e.g. a GraphQL, REST or gRPC API).

There are two ways of using an example project:

- Cloning the `prisma-examples` repo and following the instructions in the README of the example
- Selecting an example during the `prisma init` flow when starting with a new/empty database

The first approach always is based on a SQLite database preconfigured in the example's Prisma schema.

With the second approach, the Prisma CLI must download the example and perform a number of further tasks to make the example ready to use. Here is a list of tasks that need to be performed:

1. Download the selected example project from GitHub
1. Replace the `datasource` configuration in `schema.prisma` with the database credentials provided by the user
1. Migrate the database with Lift, i.e. run:
   1. `prisma2 lift save --name 'init'`
   1. `prisma2 lift up`
1. Generate Photon, i.e. run: `prisma2 generate`
1. Install npm dependencies, i.e. run: `npm install`
1. Seed the database, i.e. run: `npm run seed`
1. Print success message based on [spec](./success-screens)

## When is it used during `prisma2 init`?

The examples API is needed twice during the `prisma2 init` flow:

1. Display all available examples (_screens_: [SQLite (4)](./sqlite#4-example-selection), [MySQL (5)](./mysql#5-example-selection), [PostgreSQL (5)](./postgresql#5-example-selection))
1. [Success screens](./success-screens) (_screens_: SQLite (5), MySQL (6), PostgreSQL (6))

## Implementation

The Prisma examples API should provide an endpoint for the CLI. The CLI can use this endpoint to download the example project as well as related information in a structured way (e.g. what files were downloaded or what the next steps are).

### Implementation approaches

#### Naive (good enough)

The examples API can be implemented via a simple JSON file that contains all the infos for all examples. The CLI fetches this file and can therefore print all dynamic elements required in a success message. Here is a sample structure for the JSON file:

```jsonc
{
  "javascript": {
    // ...
    "graphql": {
      "name": "GraphQL API",
      "description": "Simple GraphQL server example",
      "pathToSeedingFile": "prisma/seed.js",
      "issuesLink": "https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/issues",
      "nextStepInstructions": [
        {
          "text": "Start the GraphQL server (in a new terminal window/tab):",
          "commands": ["npm start"]
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  },
  "typescript": {
    // ...
    "grpc": {
      "name": "gRPC API",
      "description": "Simple GraphQL gRPC client + server example",
      "pathToSeedingFile": "prisma/seed.ts",
      "issuesLink": "https://github.com/prisma/photonjs/",
      "nextStepInstructions": [
        {
          "text": "Start the gRPC server (in a new terminal window/tab):",
          "commands": ["npm start"]
        },
        {
          "text": "Invoke a gRPC client script, e.g.:",
          "commands": [
            "npm run feed # fetch all posts",
            "npm run signupUser # create new user"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### GraphQL

Alternatively, it could be implemented via a GraphQL API that's based on a similar JSON file. However, as long as the size of the JSON file is manageable, this is probably overkill.

## Example data (JSON)

{
  "javascript": {
    "graphql": {
