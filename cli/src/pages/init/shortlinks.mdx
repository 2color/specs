# Shortlinks for docs and examples

Throughout the `prisma2 init` flow, it might be helpful to link to specific docs or examples. These links should be provided via _shortlinks_ that redirect to the target page instead of linking that page directly. This has two major benefits:

- Links can be kept short which is really helpful since CLI output should be as brief and concise as possible
- The target of a link can be adjusted dynamically without touching the CLI code

## Structure

Assume we can use the domain `p.io`.

### Docs

### Examples

Shortlinks to examples should follow this pattern:

```
https://p.io/LANGUAGE/USE_CASE
```

`LANGUAGE` uses abbreviations for the respective programming language:

| Abbreviation | Language |
| --- | --- |
| js | JavaScript |
| ts | TypeScript |

Consider the [`typescript/graphql`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2/typescript/graphql) and [`javascript/script`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/prisma2/javascript/script) examples for Photon JS. Here's how they're represented as links:

```
https://p.io/ts/graphql
https://p.io/js/graphql
```
