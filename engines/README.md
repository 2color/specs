## Prisma Framework Engines

### Prisma Query Engine

Prisma query engine binary has the following use cases:

A generator like [`Photon`](https://photonjs.prisma.io)

- Uses this binary to run queries against a data source (at runtime of generated code).
- Binary is downloaded when Photon is generated.

Prisma CLI

- Generation uses this binary to fetch internal schema representation (at the time of running `generate` CLI command).
- Binary is downloaded when the CLI is installed.

### Prisma Migration Engine

Prisma migration engine binary has the following use cases:

A generator like `prisma-test-utils`

- Uses this binary to perform migrations (at runtime of generated code)
- Binary is downloaded when `prisma-test-utils` is generated.

Prisma CLI

- Lift commands use the binary to perform migrations or calculate pending migrations (at the time of running various `lift` commands like `up`, `save` etc).
- Binary is downloaded when the CLI is installed.

### Prisma Introspection Engine
