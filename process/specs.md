# Specs

## What is a spec?

Spec is short for "specification", which Wikipedia defines as follows:

> A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. A specification is often a type of technical standard. [...] The word _specification_ is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific"

For Prisma specs are documents collected in the [`prisma/specs` repository](https://github.com/prisma/specs) that define different parts of Prisma: APIs, file formats, TODO and even the specs and their process themselves (you are reading that one right now).

## When are specs created?

Specs should usually be written _before_ any implementation work begins.

TODO discussion and question issues after conversation gets more concrete we move over to specs

## Do specs reflect the present or the future?

Are of conflict: Write what we _want_ or what we _have_? As specs should be created _before_ implemetation, we obviously decided to go with the "specs describe our optimal future" approach.

## How do we specify which parts of a spec are not implemented yet?

TBD

## How are spec files structured?

TODO

### Folders and Filenames

The main structuring tool for the `specs` repo are folders. In these folders we usually have one `README.md` file that contains the actual spec. In cases where having the complete spec in one file would be counterproductive, we also use multiple files per folder.

## What should a spec contain?
