# Prisma 2 Repositories

Prisma obviously uses GitHub for hosting our git repositories. This document specifies which repositories we consider part of our main offering, and how we decide when to create an additional repository.

## Guidelines

- In theory everything could live in one big, happy repo
- Split if clearly defined separate product (Ã¨.g. `photonjs`, `lift`)
- Split if issues should be collected in separate location (e.g. `prisma-engine`)
- Split if separation necessary for technical reasons (CI, commits)  (e.g. `prisma-engine`)
